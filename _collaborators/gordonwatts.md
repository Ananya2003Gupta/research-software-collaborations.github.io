### Biography

Gordon Watts is a professor in the [Elementary Partciles Experiment](https://phys.washington.edu/epe-atlas-experiment) group in the [physics department](https://phys.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington's Seattle campus. He is a member of the [ATLAS collaboration](https://atlas.cern/) at the LHC at CERN and also the MATHUSLA collaboration. His primary physics interested there are searches for long-lived particles decaying in the calorimeter ([this recent paper](https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/EXOT-2019-23/), for example), where heavy use of Machine Learning techniques are employed. He is also deputy executive director of the [IRIS-HEP software institute](https://iris-hep.org), a software institute bring together over 20 institutions accross the USA to help build software and facilities to extract as much physics as possible from the HL-LHC experiments. His R&D work in IRIS_HEP concentrtes on the [Analysis Systems](https://iris-hep.org/as.html) focus area.
Prior to ATLAS, he was a member of the [DZERO collaboration](https://www.fnal.gov/pub/tevatron/experiments/dzero.html) at the [Tevatron accelerator](https://fnal.gov/pub/tevatron/tevatron-accelerator.html) at Fermilab in Illinois, the [CDF experiment](https://cdf.fnal.gov/) at the Tevatron, and before that the [AMY experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMY_(scientific_instrument)) on the Tristan accelerator at KEK in Japan. He has lead the flavor tagging groups in ATLAS and DZERO and worked on the top quark discovery, the single-top discovery, and higgs searches.

### Project interests

G. Watts has a broad range of interests and projects that are suitable for collaboration. Some of the projects that are directly connected with IRIS-HEP are:

* [ServiceX](https://iris-hep.org/projects/servicex.html) - High speed delivery of data using a distributed cloud-native architecture. The data is translated from experiment's custom formats into columnar data suitable for `awkward` array consumption or Root Data Frame consumption. This work involves cloud native tools, like Kubernetes, as well as python, and C++.
* [func_adl](https://iris-hep.org/projects/func-adl.html) is an embeded SQL-like language in python modeled after C#'s LINQ. The complete tool line can translate from the python to C++ or python `numpy` and `awkward` array manipulations to select the data. Used in the backend of ServiceX to select the data to be distributed.
*  Other Analysis Projects - a lot of exploratory work in using python infrastrucure and the language to enable a physicsist to quickly analyze the PB of data expected in the HL-LHC era. There are many challenges and a lot of room for innovation in this space.
