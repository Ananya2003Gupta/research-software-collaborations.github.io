### Biography and Project interests

I am S.K. Noor Alam, an experimental high-energy physicist working in the
ALICE experiment.  My  interest is to develop algorithms for loss function
which is the heart of NN and also applying advanced Machine Learning
techniques for physics-related problems ( Deep Learning NN for Heavy
Flavour Tag, vertex detection ).
