### Biography

Sourabh Dube is an experimental particle physicist and a member of CMS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. His primary research interests are the searches for particles not described by the standard model (SM), especially in leptonic final states. In the past he has worked at the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, and the CDF experiment at the Tevatron.

He obtained his Ph.D from Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey and was a Chamberlain Fellow at LBNL before joining IISER Pune.

### Project interests

His group works on searches in multilepton final states, with a focus on being as model-independent as possible. He has worked on ensuring that searches at colliders provide sufficient information such that the results remain useful for future interpretations.  His research interests include the use of multivariate algorithms such as neural networks and dimensionality reduction algorithms in BSM searches.

He is also interested in scientific outreach in society, for science in general as well as experimental particle physics.
