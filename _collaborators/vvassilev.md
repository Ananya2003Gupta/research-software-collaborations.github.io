### Biography

Dr. Vasil Vassilev is a researcher in the field of software engineering with
Princeton University. His main research interests are in the field of
programming languages ​​and systems for processing large amounts of data.

Vassil is a co-author of the interactive C++ interpreter, Cling, which
facilitates the processing of scientific data in the field of high energy
physics (HEP) and beyond. The interpreter is an essential part of the software
tools of the LHC experimental program and was part of the software used to
detect the gravitational waves of the LIGO experiment. As of today, Cling has
helped to analyze 1 Exabyte physics data, which is the basis for the publication
of over 1000 scientific publications in various scientific journals and
conferences such as Nature, Physics Letters and Physical Review Letters. For the
last 10 years he has been involved in the modernization of the specialized
software package for processing exabytes of scientific data called ROOT. The
software package is the basis of data analysis in experimental physics, playing
a significant role in the discovery of the Higgs boson from the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) and the large cavity in the Pyramid of Cheops. Led the
integration (and occasional enhancements) of the C++ Modules feature in HEP.

He is responsible for the participation of Bulgaria in the ISO C++ standards
committee and JTC1/SC22 since 2015. Code owner of Incremental compilation, REPLs
and clang-repl in the Clang compiler. Works actively in the field of Data
Science and a passionate promoter of interactive, differentiable C++ for Data
Science. Authored the C/C++ automatic differentiation library, Clad, which
enables efficient syntheses of derivatives and gradients.

Currently a Research Software Engineer with Princeton University, leading the
efforts in interactive C++ [compiler-research.org](https://compiler-research.org)
( [OAC-1931408](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1931408&HistoricalAwards=false) ).
Worked for CERN, Switzerland and FermiLab, USA.


### Project interests

Vassil is interested in collaborating in the area of programming languages,
automatic differentiation and exascale data science. In addition, he always
looks for talented students with cool ideas to help them on they way to
successful professionals.
