### Biography

I am a theoretical physicist, working mainly on quantum field theory and general relativity. Lately I have been interested in particle physics phenomenology as well, particularly processes involving fermion-fermion scattering.

### Project interests

Recently I realized that the fermion-torsion coupling is generically chiral, leading to four-fermion interactions with different coupling constants for left- and right-chiral components of different fermions. (Alternatively, different for vector and axial currents in current-current interactions.) All of these coupling constants, of mass dimension -1, are unknown and cannot be determined from theoretical considerations. They will affect all processes which involve fermion-fermion interactions, including neutrino oscillations in matter and electron-nucleon scattering, two things I am currently looking at.

My interest in HSF (or HSF-India) is to connect with people who may be interested in computing the effect of these four-fermion interactions in different processes, in accelerators and other experiments, and comparing them with experimental results.
