<h4>Research Software Collaborations in Physics</h4>
-->

{% capture irishead %}
The HSF-India network of networks aims to extend the growing research software collaborations between physics and computer science researchers in the U.S. and Europe to include researchers in India. This network-of-networks will build expertise and drive research software collaborations in areas which are critical to advance particle, nuclear and astroparticle physics research: novel approaches to analysis systems, next-generation simulation tools and methods for open science. It will connect software experts and researchers across the international community in a collaborative framework that promotes software collaborations. Immediate mutual benefits of the international collaboration will be a training network that enables early-career researchers to pursue impactful research software initiatives in ways that advance their careers in experimental data-intensive science.
HSF-India will build international collaborative structures which will enable innovation in critical software areas for discovery in particle, nuclear and astroparticle physics and lay the foundations for similar international collaborations across the scientific spectrum.
