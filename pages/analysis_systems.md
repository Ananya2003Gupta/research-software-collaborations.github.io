# Overview of Analysis Systems research area

The goal of analysis systems is to realize the maximum scientific potential of the data in the least time. The final stages of data analysis for our science are topically diverse and highly collaborative within small subsets of the experiment collaborations. Future analysis systems must be nimble enough to adapt to new opportunities for discovery and large increases in data volume and analysis complexity, and still minimize “time-to-insight”.

This research area has a rapidly increasing interest from both developers and analysts.
We are looking for interested researchers (both potential mentors and potential students) on cross-experimental
topics around software including:
  - Python ecosystem application to high-energy, nuclear and astro-particle physics data sets
  - Interoperability with data science and other ecosystems
  - Benchmarking and performance (aka, time-to-solution) improvement
  - Software and facility integration and Analysis Facility adoption
