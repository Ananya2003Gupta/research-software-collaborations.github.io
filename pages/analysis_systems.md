# Overview of Analysis Systems area research

The goal of analysis systems is to realize the maximum scientific potential of the data in the least time. The final stages of data analysis for our science are topically diverse and highly collaborative within small subsets of the experiment collaborations. Future analysis systems must be nimble enough to adapt to new opportunities for discovery and large increases in data volume and analysis complexity, and still minimize “time-to-insight”.
