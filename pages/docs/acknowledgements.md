## Acknowledgement of HSF-India support in publications and conference proceedings

It is important that funding support from HSF-India is acknowledged in all
publications and conference proceedings which result from that funding.
The following text should be used:

---

*This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant OISE-2201990.*

---

Suitable variations to also acknowledge other sources of support are of
course acceptable, but the specific award number (OISE-2201990) for HSF-India
must be included.

## Referencing HSF-India in Publications

If you need to reference/cite the HSF-India project in a Publication 
(independent from the required acknowledgement of funding support as 
described above) you have several non-exclusive choices: you can reference 
the NSF award number as above (OISE-2201990), you can reference the website: 
The BibTex entries for this would be:

```

@Misc{IRISHEPWEB,
  howpublished = "\url{http://research-software-collaborations.org}",
  title        = "{HSF-India project website}",
}
```

## Use of arXiv for conference proceedings

When publications intended for inclusion in conference proceedings are
submitted to the conference, they should **also** be submitted as a preprint
to the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org). Given the typically very long latencies for
official proceedings to appear, publishing a preprint early on the arXiv allows
them to be referenced and read soon after the conference. Subsequent
revisions due (for example) to feedback from referees of the conference
proceedings should **also** be uploaded to the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) as
new versions of the original submission.
