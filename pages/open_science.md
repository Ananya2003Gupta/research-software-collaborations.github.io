**Overview:** Particle physics has pursued open science for decades.
CERN developed the first web server in part to permit sharing of
preprints of papers, and the first server instance in the U.S. (in
1991) was at SLAC, a particle physics lab. Today this is usually
understood as enabling reproducibility and reinterpretation of
results & reuse of software and data. IRIS-HEP and its European
collaborators at CERN and in the UK have been pursuing software
elements to support this, e.g. pyhf is being used to publish
likelihoods for physics results into HEPData, a repository for
publication-related data.  The CERN open data portal and Zenodo
provide data and example software from the LHC and beyond (including
COVID-related data).

This is a broad and still developing area of research. We are looking for interested researchers
(both potential mentors and potential students) on cross-experimental
topics around software including:
  - Open dataset development
  - Analysis reproducibility
  - Result reinterpretation
