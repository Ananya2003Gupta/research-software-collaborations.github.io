<h1>Overview</h1>

HSF-India is a US National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project
that begins October 1, 2022. HSF-India will join collaborative
networks in India to networks in the U.S. and Europe in order to
build the international research software collaborations required
to reach the science goals of experimental particle, nuclear and
astroparticle physics experiments. Unanswered questions within reach
of scientists include the origin of dark matter, properties of the
Higgs Boson, the structural makeup of matter, and the mechanism to
explain neutrino mass. These are some of the highest priority science
drivers to be addressed by next-generation experimental facilities
including the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the
Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment at Fermilab, and the Electron
Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory. To fully realize
their discovery potential a new generation of software algorithms
and approaches is required. Software is an intellectual product of
this research, not just a critical tool. It has become a critical
element to design and maximize the physics discovery potential of
large data intensive science projects. Building these research
software collaborations is challenging and inherently international
matching the international nature of the experimental undertakings
themselves. HSF-India will provide students, postdocs and early
career personnel significant experience in international team science
through engagement in a diverse research community.


HSF-India will build international collaborative structures to
enable innovation in critical software areas for discovery in
particle, nuclear and astroparticle physics and lay the foundations
for similar international collaborations across the scientific
spectrum. It will seed research software collaborations on specific
projects across its networks in the U.S., Europe and India by
leveraging an international training network, fellowships and
software-focused researcher exchanges. HSF-India will iteratively
build on these seeds towards a broad and sustainable international
research software collaboration with three key research themes:

  1 **Analysis Systems:** Tools and techniques enabling next-generation
    analysis approaches to realize the maximum scientific potential
    of the data in the least time. The final stages of data analysis
    for our science are topically diverse and highly collaborative
    within small subsets of the experiment collaborations. Researchers
    are working to develop relevant analysis tools in the Python
    ecosystem, where much of the broader data science and machine
    learning innovation is also happening. These tools must be scalable,
    efficient and easy to use in order to support scientific needs
    ranging from individual researchers to those required for datasets
    of the size and complexity of the largest facilities
  1 **Novel simulation techniques** are critical tools for the increasingly
    complex questions being asked by current and planned experiments,
    and touch all aspects of exper- imental work in nuclear and
    particle physics. Traditional Monte Carlo techniques face large
    gaps with respect to needs for next-generation experiments. These
    can be closed through research that enables the efficient use of
    new computing technology; the application of machine learning
    approaches and more broadly emerging techniques such as simulation
    based inference and differentiable programming.
  1 **Tools for Open Science** will ensure that researchers benefit
    from, and contribute to, the innovation of the broader data science
    community. This includes not only openness of the software, but
    also the development of corresponding open datasets to enable
    further software evolution. An open science approach is also key
    to enable international collaborations as well as multidisciplinary
    collaborations between physicists, computer scientists and other
    data science practitioners. Finally, by developing open tools
    that are generalized to work across many experiments, they will
    also find applications beyond our own science.

As described below, it will focus on opportunities for early-career
researchers and establish mentoring and co-mentoring relationships
with more senior researchers across the networks. By engaging with
the data-science, artificial intelligence and broader computer
science communities the project will foster bottom-up alliances
around research software, for physics and beyond. HSF-India aims
to establish an environment where researchers with diverse backgrounds,
skill sets and interests can come together and build innovative
collaborations that sustain novel tools and techniques while bridging
research gaps to enable future scientific facilities.

HSF-India will focus on structured “collaboration building” activities.
We say “collaboration building” rather than directly forming
“collaborations” because an initial phase of building (often
geographically distributed) “many to many” relationships is required.
These will include:

  1 **Training events** that will build upon the curriculum being
    actively developed and used today by the HSF and IRIS-HEP. This
    will include an introduction to the current analysis, deep learning
    and data science ecosystem, software development/engineering
    skills, and best practices for collaborative work. Practical
    sessions and group "hackathons" will develop team connections.
    We aim to engage 150 students per year and have funds to assist
    with instructor travel costs and networking events.
  1 **Mentoring and co-mentoring** of early-career researchers across
    the networks. This will include curating a catalog of possible
    software-related projects of various sizes, including those sized
    for summer or semester-long projects as well as larger projects
    which are suitable to be the subject or a part of a student thesis.
  1 **Fellowship programs** for students that have participated in our
    training programs, or have equivalent experience. Fellows will
    be based at their home institute (or elsewhere as convenient) and
    interact remotely with their mentors on software projects. Projects
    will nominally have two mentors, both for practical reasons
    (holidays, busy schedules, etc), and to bring different perspectives,
    from different networks, to the problem. We also aim for projects
    where two Fellows from different countries work together under
    the same mentors on a project. We aim to support 10 students per
    year for a three month fellowship.
  1 **Researcher exchanges** organized and funded between the U.S. and
    India. While short in-person visits for training events, workshops
    and conferences can reduce barriers to communication, longer
    visits are critical to building and sustaining durable longer-term
    relationships.  We aim to provide travel support for 10 early-career
    researchers per year to participate in a researcher exchange
    across HSF-India networks.
  1 **Virtual Topical Meetings** to allow participants to periodically
    present the status of their projects as well as invited external
    speakers with relevant software activities.
  1 **Annual Project Meeting** to facilitate collaboration amongst
    HSF-India participants.

The HSF-India organizational structure will include reporting to
NSF, and a steering board. The NSF reporting will be handled primarily
by the PI-team consisting of [David Lange]https://dlange.web.cern.ch/) 
(Princeton University), [Peter Elmer](https://elmer.scholar.princeton.edu) 
(Princeton University), Rafael Coelho Lopes de Sa
(University of Massachusetts, Amherst), Verena Martinez Outschoorn
(University of Massachusetts, Amherst), and Heidi Schellman (Oregon
State University). A steering board is to be formulated at the
project kick off meeting based on an initial draft and input from
all involved collaborators. The idea is that the steering board has
a membership spanning the “networks” engaged in HSF-India research
and meetings regularly to help organize HSF-India events and
opportunities. Its makeup should include researchers from across
the engaged experiments, regions and interests, as well as of
researchers at all career stages and backgrounds.

The HSF-India network of networks extends the growing research
software collaborations between physics and computer science
researchers in the U.S. and Europe to include researchers in India.
This network-of-networks will build expertise and drive research
software collaborations in areas which are critical to advance
particle, nuclear and astroparticle physics research: novel approaches
to analysis systems, next-generation simulation tools and methods
for open science. It will connect software experts and researchers
across the international community in a collaborative framework
that promotes software collaborations. Immediate mutual benefits
of the international collaboration will be a training network that
enables early-career researchers to pursue impactful research
software initiatives in ways that advance their careers in experimental
data-intensive science.
