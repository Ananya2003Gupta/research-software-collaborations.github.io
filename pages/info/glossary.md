## Glossary

A significant amount of jargon and acronyms are used in presentations and
discussions about High Energy Physics, including in the software and
computing area. A list of general acronyms in that category can be found
on the [IRIS-HEP Glossary page](https://iris-hep.org/glossary.html) and
the [IRIS-HEP Collaborations and Related Projects page](https://iris-hep.org/collaborations). On this page we include various acronyms specifically relevant 
to the HSF-India project.

  * **DAE** - In India, the [Department of Atomic Energy](https://dae.gov.in)

  * **DOE** - In the US, the [Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov), which funds (through the [Office of Science](https://www.energy.gov/science/office-science)) fundamental research in the physical sciences. The DOE funds a number of national labs, including [Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL or Fermilab)](https://www.fnal.gov) and [Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)](https://www.bnl.gov/world/). It also supports many (but not all) nuclear and particle physics research groups in the US universities.
