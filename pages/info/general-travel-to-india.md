# General Information on travel to India

On this page we document various practical issues related to travel to
and within India by non-Indians.

Contributions are welcome. Please feel free to just add additional items
to the following list. We will eventually group them up into categories
as the number of items grows.

  * Visas: most people will need a visa to visit India. Some notes:
    * India offers the possibility of obtaining an [e-visa online](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html). Several types are offered, includnig e-Tourist, e-Business, e-Conference, etc. Applications for the e-visa are made
     via an online form (including a cost) and submitted. Approval (and
     the e-visa number) typically comes by e-mail within a few days. 
    * Several institutions, such as the Tata Institute of Fundamental
      Research (TIFR) in Mumbai and the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics
      in Kolkata, are operated by the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) of
      India. As of January, 2023, they require a proper paper visa affixed 
      in the passport (business or conference) rather than an e-visa. The
      business e-visa is not sufficient. To obtain the paper visa you
      will likely need to make an appointment and visit an Embassy or
      Consulate of India and may need to leave your passport with them.
    * To apply for the e-visa (and likely the paper visa), you will need 
      several things you may need to dig out: 
      * The visa number from your last visit to India (if applicable) 
      * A list of all countries visited in the past 10 years (although
        the form currently seemed to limit it to 20 entries)
