# General Information on travel to India

On this page we document various practical issues related to travel to
and within India by non-Indians.

Contributions are welcome. Please feel free to just add additional items
to the following list. We will eventually group them up into categories
as the number of items grows.

# Visas

Most people will need a visa to visit India. 

India offers the possibility of obtaining an [e-visa online](https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html). Several types are offered, includnig e-Tourist, e-Business, e-Conference, etc. Applications for the e-visa are made via an online form (including a cost) and submitted. Approval (and the e-visa number) typically comes by e-mail within a few days. 


Several institutions, such as the Tata Institute of Fundamental
Research (TIFR) in Mumbai and the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics
in Kolkata, are operated by the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) of
India. As of January, 2023, they require a proper paper visa affixed 
in the passport (business or conference) rather than an e-visa. The
business e-visa is not sufficient. To obtain the paper visa you
will likely need to make an appointment and visit an Embassy or
Consulate of India and may need to leave your passport with them.

To apply for the e-visa (and likely the paper visa), you will need several 
things: 
  * The visa number from your last visit to India (if applicable) 
  * A list of all countries visited in the past 10 years (although the form currently seemed to limit it to 20 entries)
