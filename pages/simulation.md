# Overview of Simulations research area

Monte Carlo simulations are critical tools for the increasingly complex questions being asked by current and planned experiments, and touch all aspects of exper- imental work in nuclear and particle physics. Accelerators and experimental apparatus are designed and optimized using sophisticated simulations. The extraction of fundamental parameters from ex- perimental data uses simulations of the theoretical models for interactions between fundamental particles as well as simulations of the interactions between particles and the detector.

Large gaps exist with respect to needs for next-generation experiments. Given the significantly increased data volumes and physics needs, critical improvements are required to keep the total computational cost within available budgets and to improve the physics fidelity of the simula- tions. The challenge here is that scale of Monte Carlo simulation needed scales with the actual data recorded.

Significant research is going into improving current tools, either in their computational techniques (eg, use of GPUs for
detector simulation) or in their physics completeness (eg, NNLO for matrix element generators).
The incorporation of new machine learning and data science approaches and methodologies into the software ecosystem also holds great promise.
